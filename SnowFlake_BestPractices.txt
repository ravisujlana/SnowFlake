LOADING:

1. Create a Schema to manage database options like stages, file format
2. Use fully qualified names
3. File format: Default is csv. Skip Header should be set to 1 if there is a header
4. File format and stage have overlapping properties. Best Practice to use separate file format
5. Size Limit on loading - loads the complete file even if exceeds limit. Will not load a subsequent file once limit is reached
6. TRUNCATECOLUMNS - default is false. Making it true truncates to column data while inserting to the length of the column definition
7.
